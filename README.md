# CI/CD Microservices Pipeline Using Jenkins and Docker

## Project Description

I built a CI/CD pipeline for microservices using Jenkins and Docker, separating the app into frontend and backend services. This project helped me improve my skills in Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker by integrating continuous testing, versioning, and deployment.

## Outcome

I successfully:

Initialize the Git and Github Repo
Created a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
Dockerized microservices for deployment.
Linked GitHub with Jenkins for automation.
Developed a basic understanding of creating APIs and connecting them with the frontend.
Gained confidence in DevOps practices.

This project equipped me with essential skills and experience that will be valuable for real-world DevOps and software development environments.

### Workflow

1. Set up Git and GitHub.
2. Build the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Create a Node.js API that returns JSON and connect it with the frontend.
4. Containerize the application using Docker.
5. Test locally: access the frontend via `localhost` and the API via `localhost:3000/data`.
6. Automate the entire process using Jenkins.

## 2. Tools and Technologies

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

- **Jenkins**: For automating the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and managing microservices.
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the source code and Jenkins pipeline.
- **Node.js**: For the backend microservice.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend microservice.
- **Python `unittest`**: For automated testing of the backend microservice.

## 3. Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and install the required tools:

### Installing Jenkins

1. Download Jenkins from the [official Jenkins website](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Open Jenkins in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` and follow the directory to get the password.

### Installing Required Jenkins Plugins

1. Open Jenkins in your web browser.
2. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
3. In the **Available** tab, search for and install the following plugins:
   - **Docker Pipeline**
   - **Git**
   - **Pipeline**
4. After installation, restart Jenkins to ensure the plugins are loaded.

## 4. Microservices Structure

- **Initialize the Git and GitHub**
  - Went to GitHub and created a new repository (e.g., microservice-cicd).
  - Initialized it with a README.md file.
  - Cloned it to the local machine using Git.

- **Frontend Service (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**
  - Developed a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - The frontend connects to the backend service through RESTful APIs.

- **Backend Service (Node.js)**
  - Built a backend service using Node.js and Express to handle API requests.
  - The backend processes data and communicates with the frontend.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

- **Jenkins Configuration**

  - Configured Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
  - Set up Jenkins on Docker to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Jenkinsfile Explained**

  - Created a Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages: Checkout, Build, Test, and Deploy.
  - Integrated Jenkins with GitHub to trigger builds on code commits.

- **Docker Integration**
  - Dockerized both frontend and backend services for consistent environments across development, and testing.
  - Used Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

## 6. Testing and Validation

For automated testing of the backend microservice, I used Pythonâ€™s `unittest` module. This module provides a framework for writing and running tests, which helps ensure that the backend code functions correctly.

- **Basic Example of `unittest` in Python**

Here's how I used `unittest` to test the backend microservice:

Code is available in Backend Folder with name `test_backend.py`

- **Testing in Docker Containers**
  - Ran tests within Docker containers to validate the functionality in isolated environments.
  - Automated the testing process as part of the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

- **Dockerized Microservices on Windows**

  - Deployed Dockerized microservices on a Windows environment.
  - Configured Docker to manage containers for both frontend and backend services.

- **Running the Pipeline in Jenkins**
  - Successfully executed the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.
