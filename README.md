# CI/CD Microservices Pipeline Using Jenkins and Docker

## Project Description

I built a CI/CD pipeline for microservices using Jenkins and Docker, separating the app into frontend and backend services. This project helped me improve my skills in Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker by integrating continuous testing, versioning, and deployment.

## Project Outcome

I successfully:

Initialize the Git and Github Repo
Created a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
Dockerized microservices for deployment.
Linked GitHub with Jenkins for automation.
Developed a basic understanding of creating APIs and connecting them with the frontend.
Gained confidence in DevOps practices.

This project equipped me with essential skills and experience that will be valuable for real-world DevOps and software development environments.

### Workflow

1. Set up Git and GitHub.
2. Build the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Create a Node.js API that returns JSON and connect it with the frontend.
4. Containerize the application using Docker.
5. Test locally: access the frontend via `localhost` and the API via `localhost:3000/data`.
6. Automate the entire process using Jenkins.

## Tools and Technologies

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

- **Jenkins**: For automating the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Docker**: For containerizing the application and managing microservices.
- **Git**: For version control and repository management.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the source code and Jenkins pipeline.
- **Node.js**: For the backend microservice.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For the frontend microservice.
- **Python `unittest`**: For automated testing of the backend microservice.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and install the required tools:

### Installing Jenkins

1. Download Jenkins from the [official Jenkins website](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
3. Open Jenkins in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080` and follow the directory to get the password.

### Installing Required Jenkins Plugins

1. Open Jenkins in your web browser.
2. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
3. In the **Available** tab, search for and install the following plugins:
   - **Docker Pipeline**
   - **Git**
   - **Pipeline**
4. After installation, restart Jenkins to ensure the plugins are loaded.

## Automated Testing with Python `unittest`

For automated testing of the backend microservice, I used Pythonâ€™s `unittest` module. This module provides a framework for writing and running tests, which helps ensure that the backend code functions correctly.

### Basic Example of `unittest` in Python

Here's how I used `unittest` to test the backend microservice:

Code is available in Backend Folder with name `test_backend.py`
