# CI/CD Microservices Pipeline Using Jenkins and Docker

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust CI/CD pipeline tailored specifically for a microservices architecture using Jenkins and Docker. By breaking down the application into independent services for frontend and backend, this project showcases my ability to streamline the development lifecycle, from code to deployment.

Through this learning experience, I improved my skills in tools like **Git**, **GitHub**, **Jenkins**, and **Docker**. Setting up and managing this pipeline allowed me to integrate continuous testing, versioning, and deployment, which significantly boosts my confidence in applying these technologies in real-world software development scenarios.

Leveraging Jenkins for automated workflows and Docker for containerization, I was able to make the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** smoother and more efficient. The hands-on experience provided deeper insights into the value of automation and testing in maintaining a scalable and flexible system. This project reinforced my ability to implement industry-standard practices in **CI/CD**.

## Project Outcome

By completing this project, I achieved:
- A complete **CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins for automating the build, test, and deployment process of microservices.
- Experience in configuring **Dockerized microservices** (frontend and backend) for streamlined deployment.
- Mastery in connecting **GitHub** for source code version control with Jenkins for pipeline automation.
- An improved understanding of how to automate deployments in a microservices architecture.
- Confidence in applying **DevOps** methodologies to make the development and deployment process more efficient, reliable, and scalable.

This project equipped me with essential skills and experience that will be valuable for real-world DevOps and software development environments.
