# CI/CD Microservices Pipeline Using Jenkins and Docker

## Project Description

I built a CI/CD pipeline for microservices using Jenkins and Docker, separating the app into frontend and backend services. This project helped me improve my skills in Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker by integrating continuous testing, versioning, and deployment.

## Outcome

I successfully:

- Initialized the Git and GitHub repo.
- Created a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
- Dockerized microservices for deployment.
- Linked GitHub with Jenkins for automation.
- Developed a basic understanding of creating APIs and connecting them with the frontend.
- Gained confidence in DevOps practices.

This project equipped me with essential skills and experience that will be valuable for real-world DevOps and software development environments.

### Workflow

1. Set up Git and GitHub.
2. Build the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Create a Node.js API that returns JSON and connect it with the frontend.
4. Containerize the application using Docker.
5. Test locally: access the frontend via `localhost` and the API via `localhost:3000/data`.
6. Automate the entire process using Jenkins.

## 4. Microservices Structure

- **Initializing the Git and GitHub Repo**
  - Went to GitHub and created a new repository (e.g., `microservice-cicd`).
  - Initialized it with a `README.md` file.
  - Cloned it to the local machine using Git.

- **Frontend Service (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)**
  - Developed a responsive frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  - The frontend connects to the backend service through RESTful APIs.

- **Backend Service (Node.js)**
  - Built a backend service using Node.js and Express to handle API requests.
  - The backend processes data and communicates with the frontend.

- **Finalizing and Pushing Changes to GitHub**
  - Committed the final changes to the local Git repository with a descriptive message.
  - Pushed the committed changes to the GitHub repository, ensuring the latest updates are reflected.
  - Updated the README file with the final project details, including steps, screenshots, and outcomes.

## 5. CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

- **Jenkins Configuration**
  - Configured Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment.
  - Set up Jenkins on Docker to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

- **Jenkinsfile Explained**
  - Created a Jenkinsfile to define the pipeline stages: Checkout, Build, Test, and Deploy.
  - Integrated Jenkins with GitHub to trigger builds on code commits.

- **Docker Integration**
  - Dockerized both frontend and backend services for consistent environments across development and testing.
  - Used Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.

## 6. Testing and Validation

For automated testing of the backend microservice, I used Pythonâ€™s `unittest` module. This module provides a framework for writing and running tests, which helps ensure that the backend code functions correctly.

- **Basic Example of `unittest` in Python**

Here's how I used `unittest` to test the backend microservice:

Code is available in the Backend folder with the name `test_backend.py`.

- **Testing in Docker Containers**
  - Ran tests within Docker containers to validate functionality in isolated environments.
  - Automated the testing process as part of the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.

## 7. Deployment

- **Dockerized Microservices on Windows - Manual Test of Docker container**
  - Build Docker Images:
    - Created the Docker image for the frontend and backend using the Dockerfile in the `frontend` and `backend` directory.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    docker build -t frontend:latest .
    ```
    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    docker build -t backend:latest .
    ```
    
 - **Run Docker Containers**:
    - Launched the frontend container in detached mode, mapping port 80 of the container to port 80 on the host.
    - Launched the backend container in detached mode, mapping port 3000 of the container to port 3000 on the host.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 80:80 frontend:latest
    ```
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 backend:latest
    ```

   - **Verify Running Containers**:
    - Verified that both frontend and backend containers were running by listing active containers.
    ```bash
    docker ps
    ```

 - **Access Applications**:
    - **Frontend**: Opened a browser and navigated to `http://localhost` to view the frontend microservice.
    - **Backend**: Navigated to `http://localhost:3000/data` to view the backend microservice's JSON response.

 - **Commit and Push Dockerfiles**:
    - Committed and pushed Dockerfiles to the repository for version control.

- **Running the Pipeline in Jenkins - Automated Test to Build and Deploy**
  - Successfully executed the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.
  - Deployed updates automatically to the Dockerized environment upon code changes.
