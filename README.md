# CI/CD Microservices Pipeline Using Jenkins and Docker

## Project Description

I built a CI/CD pipeline for microservices using Jenkins and Docker, separating the app into frontend and backend services. This project helped me improve my skills in Git, GitHub, Jenkins, and Docker by integrating continuous testing, versioning, and deployment.

## Project Outcome

I successfully:

Initialize the Git and Github Repo
Created a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins.
Dockerized microservices for deployment.
Linked GitHub with Jenkins for automation.
Developed a basic understanding of creating APIs and connecting them with the frontend.
Gained confidence in DevOps practices.

This project equipped me with essential skills and experience that will be valuable for real-world DevOps and software development environments.

### Workflow

1. Set up Git and GitHub.
2. Build the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
3. Create a Node.js API that returns JSON and connect it with the frontend.
4. Containerize the application using Docker.
5. Test locally: access the frontend via `localhost` and the API via `localhost:3000/data`.
6. Automate the entire process using Jenkins.
